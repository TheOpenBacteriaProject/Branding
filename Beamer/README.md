# Beamer

This Beamer is a remix of [Beamer mtheme](github.com/matze/mtheme) wher it basics we quote next. Here you have all the elements you will need for Beamer compilation but if you want your own modified theme we recommend you to modify matze theme.

Anyway, for knowing all its possibilities we also recommend [matze repository](github.com/matze/mtheme).

## Beamer mtheme

The *mtheme* is a Beamer theme with minimal visual. The core design principles
of the theme were described in a [blog post](http://bloerg.net/2014/09/20/a-modern-beamer-theme.html).
Not convinced?  Have a look at the [demo slides](demo.pdf).

### Requirements

As of now, fonts, colors and the section indicator are hardcoded into the theme.
Thus to compile the demo with `make` you must:

* Use XeLaTeX,
* Install the [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) font
* Have a usable TikZ installation.


### License

The theme itself is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). This
means that if you change the theme and re-distribute it, you *must* retain the
copyright notice header and license it under the same CC-BY-SA license. This
does not affect the presentation that you create with the theme.
